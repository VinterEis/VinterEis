                <h2>What's Programming Language</h2>
                <p>A programming language is a piece of code that translate what we understand into binary code to give instructions to computers on what to do. they're used for making software, websites, mobile applications, etc. The first programming language was Autocode developed by Alick Glennie in 1952.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Compiled and Interpret Programming language</h2>
                <p>Compilation is the process of translating the entire source code of a program into machine code before the program is executed. This is done by a compiler. Otherwise, Interpretation is the process of translating source code into machine code line by line or statement by statement, during the execution of the program. This is done by an interpreter.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>High-level and Low-level programming</h2>
                <p>High level language like python and java is more on readability and simplicity, but less control over hardware and slower on performance. On the other hand, Low level programming like C and C++ is more efficient for optimized performance, but it's harder to learn and take more time to developed your application.</p>

                <h3>SQL (Structured Query Language)</h3>
                <p>SQL is a non-procedural programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. Non-procedural language means users can specify what they want (queries) rather than how to do it (as in procedural languages). SQL enables users to store, manipulate, and retrieve data from databases. SQL is used to create and modify database schemas (Data Definition Language), insert, update, and delete records (Data Manipulation Language), and query the database for specific information (SELECT statements). Its syntax is standardized, but variations exist between database management systems (DBMS), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and others. Its versatility and ease of use make it a fundamental tool for developers, data analysts, and database administrators to manage and leverage data with efficiency.</p>
