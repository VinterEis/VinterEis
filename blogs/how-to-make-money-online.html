                    <h3>8. Rent Out Your Wi-Fi Bandwidth</h3>

                    <p>Renting out your Wi-Fi Bandwidth means sharing the unused portion of your internet connection — and getting paid for it. It's like Airbnb for your internet connection. You're not sharing your personal data, just letting others use a small portion of your connection.</p>

                    <p>To do it, you can rent out your unused Wi-Fi bandwidth through apps and platforms like Honeygain, PacketStream, or Peer2Profit. These services use your internet connection to power things like data research or content delivery networks. Once you sign up and install their app, it runs in the background and shares a small portion of your bandwidth. In return, you get paid based on how much data is used. It's an easy, hands-off way to make money—just make sure your internet plan allows it.</p>

                    <p>The downsides of Renting out your Wi-Fi Bandwidth are that your Wi-Fi could become slightly slower, and your device needs to stay on with a good connection. The more your connection stay and is used by others, the more your get. I believe this great for those of you who work on your device for a long time and have an idle Wi-Fi connection.</p>
