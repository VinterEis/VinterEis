                <h2>Brief Facts About the Glaciers</h2>
                <p>Glaciers are large masses of land ice that form over centuries as layer of snow compress and harden. Glaciers mostly found near the North or South Poles and at high altitudes. They cover about 3% of our planet's surface and 11% of earth's land area, and also play an important role in Earth's climate.</p>

                <p>Although these glaciers size might not entirely accurate because their size is always changing due to climate change and measurements may vary, or even there are other larger glaciers that I may not have discovered yet, but I will do my best to keep this page updated.</p>

                    <h3>Lambert Glacier (Antarctica)</h3>
                    <p>Located in the eastern part of Antarctica, Lambert Glacier is the world's largest glacier with its 400 km (250 miles) in length and 2,500 m (8200 feet) in depth. Lambert glacier covered over one million square kilometres (386,000 sq miles). Its flow rate is significant and contributes large amounts of ice to the Amery Ice Shelf (one of the largest ice shelves in Antarctica), which impacts global sea levels.</p>

                <div id="b">
                    <h3>Pine Island Glacier (Antarctica)</h3>
                    <p>Pine island glacier is one of the fastest melting glacier located in West Antarctica. It covers an area of about 175,000 sq km (68,000 sq mi) with the thickness 2 km on average. Pine Island Glacier flows into the Amundsen Sea along with the Thwaites Glacier. Due to its fast flow rate, thinning, and retreat, Pine Island Glacier has become a major focus for scientists concerned about sea level rise and climate change.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="c">
                    <h3>Thwaites Glacier (Antarctica)</h3>
                    <p>Thwaites glacier, often referred as doomsday glacier is located in West Antarctica. It has the area of around 192,000 sq km (74,000 sq mi) and the estimated volume of around 483,000 cubic kilometres with the thickness of about 800 - 1,200 metres (2,600 - 3,900 miles). Thwaites Glacier is known for its retreat and instability. over last few decades, Thwaites Glacier has receded by approximately 14 km (9 miles). Scientists estimate that if Thwaites Glacier and its surroundings were to collapse completely, global sea levels could rise by as much as 0.6 metres (2 feet).</p>

                <div id="d">
                    <h3>Denman Glacier (Antarctica)</h3>
                    <p>Denman glacier was found in 1912 by the Autralasian Antarctic Expedition. It covers an area of around 25,000 sq km and is about 110 km (70 miles) in length. With a depth of over 3,500 m (11,500 ft), it is one of the deepest glaciers on earth. The glacier extends beneath the ice towards the Antarctic interior. This bedrock slope runs downward, which could destabilize the glacier as warm ocean water seeps in, potentially causing it to retreat more rapidly.</p>

                    <h3>Jakobshavn Glacier (Greenland)</h3>
                    <p>Jakobshavn glacier is located in West Greenland near the Ilulissat Icefjord and known as the fastest moving glacier in the world. It drains about 7% of the Greenland Ice Sheet and flows at an annual average rate of around 45 metres (150 feet) per day. It's more than 65 km in length, has a typical thickness over one km and covers the area of around 110,000 square kilometres. Jakobshavn's fast flow is driven in part by its steep and narrow channel, which funnels ice quickly toward its terminus.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Located in southeast Iceland, Vatnajökull Glacier is the largest glacier in Europe. It covers an area of over 8,100 square kilometres with the average thickness of around 380 m (1,250 feet). It's also known for its spectacular landscapes and has the highest peak in Iceland, Hvannadalshnúkur, which stands at 2,110 metres (6,923 feet) above sea level. Vatnajökull lies over several active volcanoes and geothermal areas that could be crucial to the glaciers.</p>

                    <h3>Austfonna Ice Cap (Norway)</h3>
                    <p>Located high in the Arctic's Circle on Nordaustlandet, Svalbard, Austfonna is the second largest glacier in europe. It covers a significant portion of the island, with an area of approximately 7,800 sq km (3,000 sq miles), the average thickness of around 200 to 300 metres, and its volume is about 1,900 cubic km. Austfonna has a unique dome-shaped ice cap that allows for the radial flow of ice, with numerous outlet glaciers extending toward the sea.</p>

                    <h3>Bering Glacier (Alaska)</h3>
                    <p>Located in coastal southern Alaska, Bering Glacier is the largest glacier in North America. It covers an area of approximately 5,200 square kilometres (2,000 sq miles) and stretches 119 km (119 miles). It spans a vast area and plays a critical role in Alaska's hydrology, local ecosystems, and glaciology research. Bering Glacier has been retreating over recent decades due to warmer climate. It flows into Vitus Lake and then drains into the Gulf of Alaska through Bering River.</p>

                <div id="i">
                    <h3>Flade Isblink Ice Cap (Greenland)</h3>
                    <p>Located in the northeastern part of Greenland. Flade Isblink Ice Cap covering a significant portion of Greenland Ice Sheet, it spans an area of around 8,500 square km (3,300 sq miles) and has the average thickness of around 600 metres. The region is relatively isolated, located on the rugged and remote coastal fringe of Greenland. The ice cap's glaciers flow outward, contributing to the Greenland Ice Sheet. Some of these glaciers flow into fjords and can cause icebergs to break off into the sea.</p>

                <div id="j">
                    <h3>Humboldt Glacier (Greenland)</h3>
                    <p>Humboldt Glacier is one of greenland's biggest glaciers located in northwest coast of Greenland, it was named after the german naturalist Alexander von Humboldt. Humboldt Glacier covers an area of around 4000 sq km (1,500 sq miles). With the average flow rate of 100 to 200 metres per year, the Humboldt Glacier is relatively stable compared to some Greenland's glaciers.</p>
