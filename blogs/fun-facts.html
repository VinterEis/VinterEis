                <h3>With No Food You Can Survive About A Week</h3>
                <p>While humans can typically survive for about a week without food, the absence of water is far more critical. Dehydration sets in much quicker, and most people can only last around 3 days without water. The human body can survive for an extended period, typically 1 to 2 months, if you have access to water but no food. During this time, your body will start breaking down fat and muscle for energy, but staying hydrated is crucial. Without water, survival becomes impossible in just a few days, but with it, your body can keep functioning even without food for much longer.</p>
