                <h3>Antarctica Has the Coldest and Extreme Climate on Earth</h3>
                <p>Antarctica is the coldest, windiest, and driest continent on Earth. The lowest temperature ever recorded on Earth (-128.6°F / -89.2°C) was measured at Antarctica's Soviet Union's Vostok Station. The average wind velocity in Antarctica is about 19 km/h, but in winter it can exceed 200 km/h.</p>

                <h3>Antarctica Used to be Green</h3>
                <p>The discovery of vegetation fossils proved that Antarctica used to be green. Approximately 56 million years ago, Antarctica was still joined to both Australia and South America. During these time Antarctica was green and covered by rainforest.</p>

                <h3>Antarctica is Protected by The Antarctic Treaty System</h3>
                <p>Antarctica is governed by the Antarctic Treaty System, which was signed in 1959 by 12 countries. It sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, establishes freedom of scientific investigation, and bans military activity on the continent.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Antarctica Host a Variety Flora and Fauna</h3>
                <p>Despite its extreme conditions, Antarctica hosts a variety of organisms adapted to its environment, including penguins, seals, seabirds, and various types of algae, moss, and lichens. Most of these species are found along the coast and rely on the nutrient-rich waters of the Southern Ocean.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Antarctic Tourism Destination</h3>
                <p>Antarctica has become a destination for tourism, with visitors typically arriving by ship to explore its unique landscapes, observe wildlife, and experience its pristine environment. Strict regulations are in place to protect the fragile ecosystem.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Antarctica Has a Variety of Environmental Concerns</h3>
                <p>Despite its isolation, Antarctica faces environmental challenges, including the impacts of climate change, marine pollution, and potential disruption from increased human activity such as tourism and fishing.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Antarctic Ice Shelves</h3>
                <p>Antarctica has large floating ice shelves, such as the Ross and Filchner-Ronne, the largest ice shelves. Ice shelves play an important role as crucial indicators of climate change as they melt and retreat.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Antarctica Holds the Most Fresh Water</h3>
                <p>More than 60% of fresh water on Earth stored as ice and snow in Antarctica. This frozen reservoir is enough to raise global sea levels by over 68 metres (190 feet) if it were to melt completely.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>There are Lots of Buried Mountains in Antarctica</h3>
                <p>In fact, the snow in Antarctica is really thick, more than 1.5 km on average, makes many mountains covered by snow.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Antarctica is the Highest Continent</h3>
                <p>Antarctica is known as the highest continent, with the average glacier thickness over 2.1km on average, making it as the highest continent on Earth.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Subglacial Lakes</h3>
                <p>Vostok is the largest glacial lake Antarctica with the area of about 6,058 mi². More than 600 subglacial lakes found in Antarctica, These lakes are found underneath from the surface of thick ice.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Antarctic Peninsula</h3>
                <p>The Antarctic Peninsula extends 1,300 km (800 miles) toward South America and is one of the fastest-warming regions on the planet. This warming trend is affecting the local ecosystems and ice stability.</p>

                <h3>Site of the Most Significant Ozone Depletion</h3>
                <p>Antarctica has been the site of the most significant ozone depletion, often referred to as the ozone hole. This was caused by human-made chemicals, particularly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and the Antarctic right conditions that form Polar stratospheric clouds in winter and the sunlight-catalyzed reaction cause these gases more effective at depleting the ozone layer in this region.</p>

                <h3>Ancient Ice</h3>
                <p>Some of the ice in Antarctica is millions of years old. Observe ancient ice helps scientists understand Earth's historical climate and atmospheric conditions.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Antarctic Sound</h3>
                <p>The Antarctic Sound is a strait separating the Antarctic Peninsula from the continent. It is known for its dramatic ice formations and is a key navigation route for research expeditions and tourism.</p>

                <h3>Antarctica Has River</h3>
                <p>Despite its frigid weather, there are several rivers flow across the continent, especially in the summer. The longest river in Antarctica is Onyx, which is about 32 km long.</p>

                <h3>Antarctic Blood Falls</h3>
                <p>A rare occasion in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Blood Falls oozes a vivid crimson liquid that flows starkly against the pristine white ice. The blood colour itself is actually iron-rich brine, which turns red upon exposure to oxygen. This phenomenon reveals an ancient, isolated ecosystem trapped beneath the ice for over a million years. The water is hyper-salty and lacks oxygen, yet microorganisms thrive in this extreme environment.</p>

                <h3>Meteorite Hunting Paradise</h3>
                <p>Antarctic icy surface makes it the treasure trove for meteorite hunters. When meteorites land on the ice, they're preserved for millenia due to the icy cold. The moving ice sheets transport these space rocks into concentrated areas known as meteorite stranding zones.</p>

                <h3>Antarctica is the Largest Ice Sheet.</h3>
                <p>The Antarctic ice sheet covers over 14 million square kilometres (5.4 million sq miles) or around 98% of Antarctica, almost the entire continent. And it's estimated to contain 90% of world's ice.</p>
