            <section class="why">
                <h2>Why we really need to take quick action to stop global warming</h2>
                <p>Our planet has already warmed by more than 1 &deg;C. It may not seem like much, but it actually really affect the global ecosystem around the world. Every day, human activities produce about 90 Metric tons of CO2 and over 30,000 hectares of rainforest are lost every day, causing glaciers to melt and sea levels to rise. Every little step is important for this planet, here are 15 ways we can do to reduce and stop global warming:</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Plant More Trees and Support Reforestation Efforts</h3>
                <p>You can plant more plants or trees in your home or land and help communities out there to plant more trees. The more trees are planted, the more CO2 emissions reduced and also the better air quality will be. Plus, trees make spaces more beautiful and pleasant.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Use More Renewable Energy Sources</h3>
                <p>Renewable energy like wind, solar, and hydro produces little to no greenhouse gas emission compared to fossil fuels, also it's lower on energy cost. It's really important for the whole world to make a fast transition to renewable energy. Installing solar panels or wind turbines in your home is a good effort to reduce greenhouse emission and decrease air pollution.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Save Energy and Improve Its Efficiency</h3>
                <p>Turn off your electronics while not being used, use appliance and lightning with high energy efficiency, Keep heating and cooling systems well-maintained for optimal performance. This small approach is absolutely really important to avoid climate change, also it's beneficial for minimizing your energy bills.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Don't Waste Your Food</h3>
                <p>When food is goes to landfill, it produces greenhouse gases such as methane that is more potential than CO2. That's why you need to abstain from wasting your food.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Adopt Green Building Practises</h3>
                <p>Green building practices involves integrating strategies that minimize environmental impact and enhance sustainability throughout a building's lifecycle. This includes using energy-efficient systems, sustainable materials, and water-conserving fixtures, as well as incorporating renewable energy sources and green roofs. Emphasizing indoor air quality, efficient insulation, and sustainable site development further supports eco-friendly goals. Achieving certifications like LEED or BREEAM can validate these efforts, while ongoing education ensures the adoption of the latest sustainable technologies and practices.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Support Sustainable Businesses</h3>

            <section>
                <h3>Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle</h3>
                <p>Reduce is to use less of something to minimize waste and conserve resources. Reuse is to use items and materials multiple times or for different purposes to minimize waste and reduce the demand for new resources. Last one, Recycle is to process used materials into new products to reduce waste and conserve resources.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Waste-to-Energy</h3>
                <p>Convert organic waste into energy through processes like anaerobic digestion or waste incineration.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Don't make a smoke or burn things</h3>
                <p>This is necessary to avoid CO2 and other gas emission to be produced.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Use Eco-Friendly Transportation</h3>
                <p>Drive less, switch to hybrid or electric vehicles, use public transportation, or even biking and walking are the best option for travelling short distance. With these you can help reduce or stop amounts of CO2 produced.</p>
