                <h3>Plant More Trees and Support Reforestation Efforts</h3>
                <p>You can plant more plants or trees in your home or land and help communities out there to plant more trees. The more trees are planted, the more CO2 emissions reduced and also the better air quality will be.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Use More Renewable Energy Sources</h3>
                <p>Renewable energy like wind, solar, and hydro produces little to no greenhouse gas emission compared to fossil fuels, also it's lower on energy cost. It's important for the whole world to make a fast transition to renewable energy. Installing solar panels or wind turbines in your home is a good effort to reduce or get rid of greenhouse emission.</p>
            </section>
