            <h2>Actic and North Pole</h2>
            <p>The Arctic circle starts approximately 66&deg; 30' latitude, and the North Pole is exactly 90&deg;. The Arctic is slightly warmer than Antarctica, with average temperature of -12 &deg;C to -6 &deg;. It's a unique biome with extreme climates and distinctive ecosystems that have adapted to its harsh environment.</p>
            <p>Here are some interesting facts about Arctic!</p>

                <h3>It's Home to Polar Bears</h3>
                <p>The Arctic is home to unique wildlife such as polar bears, Arctic foxes, Caribou and various migratory birds such as Arctic tern. These animals have adapted to the harsh conditions of the polar environment.</p>

                <h3>Arctic Has Extreme Climate</h3>
                <p>Strong wind and snowstorms often occur in this region, especially in the winter. Its temperatures can plunge below -45°C (-50°F), and the lowest temperature ever recorded in Arctic is -69.6 &deg;C (-93 &deg;F) located in Klinck AWS, Greenland.</p>

                <h3>Most of the Arctic land is Permafrost</h3>
                <p>Most of the Arctic landscape is covered by permafrost (soil that remains frozen all year round). Thawing permafrost can release trapped greenhouse gases that can affect global climate.</p>

                <h3>North Pole is Mostly Ocean</h3>
                <p>Different form the South Pole, where mostly consists of landmass. The North pole or Arctic is mostly of ocean with the  average depth range from 4,000 feet to 18,000, covered by floating sea ice. The ice is constantly changing due to seasonal shifts, and the ice is gradually shrinking due to climate change, causing more ice to melt in the summer.</p>

                <h3>Arctic Affect Global Ocean Circulation</h3>
                <p>The Arctic Ocean plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation. The cold, dense water that forms in the Arctic sinks and helps drive the global thermohaline circulation, a major component of Earth's climate system.</p>

                <h3>Magnetic North Pole</h3>
                <p>It's important to note that the geographic North Pole (the point where the Earth's axis of rotation intersects the surface) is different from the magnetic North Pole, which is the point that the Earth's magnetic field points towards. The magnetic North Pole is currently located in the Arctic Ocean, but it shifts over time due to changes in the Earth's magnetic field.</p>

                <h3>There's A Large Canyon Inside The Greenland Glaciers</h3>
                <p>The large canyon inside the Greenland glaciers is known as the Greenland Ice Sheet's subglacial canyon. This canyon, discovered in recent years through radar surveys and other scientific techniques, lies beneath the ice sheet and is part of a complex network of rivers and valleys carved by ancient glacial and river activity. The canyon is estimated to be about 750 kilometers (466 miles) long, up to 5 kilometers (3 miles) deep, and 40 kilometers (25 miles) wide. It is significant because it influences the ice sheet's dynamics, affecting how ice flows and contributes to our understanding of past and present ice sheet behavior.</p>

                <h3>Arctic During Pleistocene Era</h3>
                <p>During the Pleistocene Ice Age (2.58 ma - 11.700 years ago) glaciers covered about 8% of Earth surface and sea level about 400 feet lower than today. The thickness of the Arctic ice can exceed 3 km that time, and present ice thickness is only about 2 to 5 meters on average.</p>

                <h3>Its Northern Light</h3>
                <p>Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis, are captivating natural light displays caused by charged particles from the sun colliding with Earth's magnetic field and atmospheric gases. They Produce colorful lights, mainly green and red from oxygen and purples and blues from nitrogen. The auroras are most visible near the magnetic poles in winter months and are influenced by solar activity such as solar flares. They appear in various dynamic forms like arcs and curtains and have been integral to both scientific studies of space weather and cultural folklore across different societies.</p>
