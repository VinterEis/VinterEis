                <h3>Site of The Most Significant Ozone Depletion</h3>
                <p>Antarctica has been the site of the most significant ozone depletion, often referred to as the ozone hole. This was caused by human-made chemicals, particularly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and the Antarctic right conditions that form Polar stratospheric clouds in winter and the sunlight-catalyzed reaction cause these gases more effective at depleting the ozone layer in this region.</p>
